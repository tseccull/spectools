	Description --------------------------------------------------------
	This script applies a correction to input 1D astronomical 
	spectroscopic data based on the measured atmospheric extinction
	curve of the observing site. The 1D spectrum and its uncertainties
	are each multiplied by 10 ^ (0.4 * airmass * k(lambda)), where
	airmass is the mean airmass at which the spectrum was observed and
	k(lambda) is the wavelength dependent extinction curve of the
	observing site given in magnitudes per unit airmass. Note that the
	extinction curves used here are averages that do not account for
	variable atmospheric extinction due to variable concentrations of
	atmospheric water vapour or scattering particles. When comparing or
	calibrating one corrected spectrum with another it is assumed that 
	atmospheric conditions were stable across the consecutive 
	observations of both targets.This script does not create new files,
	but instead just updates the input files. extinct.py is only readily
	compatible with spectra extracted by MOTES, and it should be run on 
	individual 1D spectra of a given target prior to stacking them.
